\chapter*{Abstract}
In a world with continuously increasing techological capabilities, the demand for answers increases alongside it.  The domain of professional sports in particular is no exception to this trend.  The very essence of competitive sports is rooted in a desire to optimize and gain every advantage over competitors. In this paper, we describe classification methodologies for predicting the performance of professional athletes through a scoped analysis of the long-time NBA allstar, Kobe Bryant. We detail three simulations modelling shooting accuracy over Bryant's 20 year career, using logistic regression and discriminant analyses to yield predictions about Bryant's theoretical future performance.  We show that Bryant's potential to score is strongly dependent on his distance from the basket when shooting.  We also show that Bryant's scoring performance in the post-season, as compared to that of the regular season, is consistent with his performance at any other point in the season.
