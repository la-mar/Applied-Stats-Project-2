With modern computers and the popularity of the budding disciple of data science, there are numerous predictive technologies readily available.  In professionl sports alone, a host of disparate entities, players, ogranizations, and gamblers alike are hungry for new insights. Each bears an economic imperative to seek advantages and optimizations that will give them an edge over their peers.  Technology, however, does not predicate useful and effective models.  It is the rigorous application of sound statistical theory that yields actionable conclusions.  Unfortunately, the appeal of novel algorithms and the sparkles of big data detract from the importance of a strong statistical foundation.  Thus, we seek to right the ship of this rampant malpractice as it applies to this problem domain.  In what follows, we explore insights we have garnered from the application of linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression, then leveraging those insights to appropriately tune the final predictive model.

Kobe Bryant marked his retirement from basketball by scoring 60 points in his final game as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers team on Wednesday, April 13, 2016. Starting to play professional basketball at the age of 17, Kobe earned the sportâ€™s highest accolades throughout his long career.  Using 20 years of data on Kobe's shots made and shots missed, we wish to predict which shots will be successful.
